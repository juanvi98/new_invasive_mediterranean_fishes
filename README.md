Hi!
This is the code for finding new invasive fish species (Mediterranean ones in this case), as long as they are described in Fishbase.
The Scripts have been created in this order: 
1-Database formation: Creation of the general list of fishes to analyse (Individual research). There's an excell called "lista_invasoras" that contains information about the selected invasive species.
2-Trait_extraction: Thanks to "rfishbase" package.
3 and 4-Correlation and Imputation: Correlation analysis and imputation of the selected variables.
5-Descriptive analysis: Basic descriptive analysis of the final variables.
6-Modelling_and_predictions: Model selection by "Bdiclcpomodel_stack (1)" iterative function. Final model analysis and predictions of "potential" future invaders.
Good luck!
